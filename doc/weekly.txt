What do I need it for?
======================

1. store tasks in a style like Getting Things Done (GTD) that is
 - tasks
 - projects
 - time of the task (like reminders, TAF-TAF)
2. backlog of tasks
3. log what I am doing and working on
4. print out what I did in a time frame



Features, Data Items, Data Structures
=====================================

* TASK
- a to do thing
- Has:
 - ID
 - State( Open, Closed, OnHold, Stopped)
 - PROJECT (one)
 - creation date
 - (0) Due Date
 - (o) location
 - (o) expiration date
 - (o) context (like - a meeting it relates to)
 - (0) reminders
 - (0) ACTIVITY(s)
 - (o) subTASK(s)
 - (o) parent TASK

* ACTIVITY
 - describes an activity that is being done
 - can be an activity on a task
 - of descriptive manner - with goal in mind - what did I work on
 - Has:
  - ID
  - State (Started, Ended, Stopped) [note that the fact that an ACTIVITY does not
            have an 'Ended' time does not mean it did not end]
  - start time
  - end time
  - (o)related TASK(s) (and through this - PROJECT and MEGAPROJECT

* PROJECT
 - a central theme that has multiple TASKs and ACTIVITIES related to it
 - a set of TASKS and ACTIVITYs
 - Has
  - ID
  - (o) start, end, duedate


* MEGAPROJECT
 - a big thing project that includes several projects. perhaps just 'home' and 'work'
 - Has:
  - ID
  - State

* Procedures
 - clean - checks the database for correctness and fixes (with permission)
   example: due date things, projects w/o tasks, tasks w/o projects etc

* Interface context
 - after a command is executed, some of its context remain, so it is easier to
    perform the next command in that context.
    for example: after creating a task, the task remains in the context, and one can
    set some of the attributes for that task in the following command.
    only a subset of the commands looks at the context

list of PROJECTS

list of MEGAPROJECTS
Home
Work

Consider:
 - priority

Language/Syntax
================
Terms:
sw - single word (== characters w/o spaces)
mw - multiple words (== including spaces)

command:
Create megaproject <name sw> #<description mw>
return:
megaproject ID

command:
Create project <name sw> @<megaproject sw> #<description mw>
return:
project ID

command:
task @<project sw> #<description mw>
return:
task ID

command:
Attach <something A> to <Something B> #<the value of what to attach, sw or mw>
Somthing A      Something B     Meaning
Task            Project
Activity        Task
Task            Activity
Task            Task            create subtask
return:
completion report, what happened

command:
Set <attribute sw> @<ID of a the item> to #<the value to be set for, sw or mw>
return:
Completion report, including old value and new value

command:
Start @<ID of a Task or a project or 0 (for non affiliated activity)> #<description of the activity mw>
return:
ACTIVITY ID, Start time, info from related task

command:
Stop @<ACTIVITY ID>
return:
Completion status, start and stop time, info from related task

command:
Continue @<ACTIVITY ID>
return:
Completion status, Start time, info from related task

command:
Search @<field name or 'All' to get all fields> #<text to look for, sw or mw>
return:
List of items which satisfy the search criteria


command:
List <Item (TASK, ACTIVITY, ...) | <criteria>
    criteria = dates, IDs, start date, completed, etc.
    syntax is TBD
    *list @XXXX   (ID)
    *list m/p/t/a (meanining - all of them)
    *list m/p/t/a limit [xx = 10 by default]
    *list next [after limit, but not necessarily]
    ****list m/p/t/a col[umn] col_name is/inc/not/ninc yyyy
    *list m/p/t/a col[umn] col_name range low high
      low high => ID, time
      bot[tom] - the lowers possible low
      top      - the highest possible high
    *list m/p/t/a for m/p/t/a nnnn
    *list m for p nnnn
    *list p for m nnnn
    *list t for p nnnn
    *list a for p nnnn
    *list a for t nnnn
    *list m/p/t/a columns
    *list m/p/t/a states
    <><>list m/p/t/a head [xx]
    <><>list m/p/t/a tail [xx]
    <><>list m/p s ==> list all uniqe megaprojects and projects
    *list a/t wwxx => lists activities for work week for the last 12 months
    *list search | <mw> [regular expression search all over]
    --
    constructs, can be combined:
    field in yyyy
    field in range low high
    for p/m/t nnnn
    --
    field: match the one in the dataframe, but can be in lower case
return:
List of

command:
ci [p/m x]
co
==> lists the time as an activity with time adjustment (p/m = plus/minus, x = hours)
returns:
Acknoledge


command:
clean
    check that all relations are legal
    check that non legal fields for items are indeed not set

return:
requests for permission per fix it needs to do
completion message for each fix operation

command:
die
return:
Nothing. Gracefully kill the program - client and server


command:

return:

Database
========

Have multiple data bases
 - one for mega projects
 - one for projects
 - one for tasks
 - one for activities
 - one for context
??

Database columns:
Type
    or ? a column for each type itself
    Task
    Activity
    Project
    Megaproject
Creation date
State
?State history (free text of all transitions and timestamps?)
Completion Date
ID
Parent
Content
Context


Operation
=========


Comments for later
===================

1. consep[t of context for consecutive commands
2. each message (client-server or server-client) need to have an ID and be logged,
   since it will help debug later. perhaps more info (like time also)
3. teh db is stored on disk after each operation. the older version is also stored
    so after each transaction, we have current and previous versions on disk
4. there seems to be a problem with the fact that i am using tokenize. it treats things
    that look like operators even if are in the middle of free text ... this is
    problematic in long descriptions, for example.
    need to see what can be done.
5. today | something I want to do today [create a task for today in a project named today(?)
